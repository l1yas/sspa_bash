# SSPA – Security & System Administration Suite

**SSPA** (Security System & Process Automation) is a collection of **Linux system hardening, monitoring, auditing, and backup tools** developed in Bash.
It is designed for **educational, red-team learning, and lab purposes**, providing hands-on experience in **system security, logging, and automation**.

| **sspa_alerts**     | Security alert system for monitoring suspicious system events and generating HTML reports.                                        |
| **sspa_intrusions** | Toolset to detect, log, and simulate intrusion attempts for testing security policies.                                            |
| **sspa_promon**     | Process and resource monitoring script; tracks CPU, memory usage, and alerts on thresholds.                                       |
| **sspa_saves**      | Backup and integrity tool; manages file backups, encrypted archives, and SHA-256 integrity checks.                                |
| **sspa_secaudit**   | Security auditing tool; performs system audits for permissions, SSH config, open ports, and privileged users.                     |
| **sspa_secharden**  | System hardening script; corrects dangerous permissions, disables unnecessary services, secures SSH, and configures UFW firewall. |

## Features

* **Backup & Integrity:** Automated file backups, encrypted archives, SHA-256 checks.
* **System Auditing:** Checks for insecure permissions, weak SSH settings, open ports, and admin users.
* **Process Monitoring:** Alerts for high CPU/memory usage; optional logging.
* **Hardening:** Automatic hardening of SSH, permissions, services, and firewall configuration.
* **Logging & Reporting:** Centralized logging with timestamps; HTML reports for SSPA Alerts.



## Usage Overview

Each module has its own README for detailed instructions.
Basic usage patterns:

### SSPA Saves

```bash
sudo ./sspa_saves.sh -s /path/source /path/dest       # Backup a file
sudo ./sspa_saves.sh -a /folder /archive.zip password # Compress & encrypt
sudo ./sspa_saves.sh -c file1 file2                   # Check integrity
```

### SSPA SecHarden

```bash
sudo ./sspa_secharden.sh        # Apply system hardening
sudo ./sspa_secharden.sh --dry-run # Simulate hardening without changes
```

### SSPA SecAudit

```bash
sudo ./sspa_secaudit.sh -f /       # Audit dangerous permissions
sudo ./sspa_secaudit.sh -s         # Audit SSH config
sudo ./sspa_secaudit.sh -p 22,80  # Audit allowed ports
```

### Logging & Reports

* Logs are stored in `/var/log/` per module.
* HTML reports are generated by `sspa_alerts` for visual review.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

* These scripts are intended for **educational purposes**.
* Use **at your own risk** on production systems.
* Always test in **VMs or lab environments** before deployment.
